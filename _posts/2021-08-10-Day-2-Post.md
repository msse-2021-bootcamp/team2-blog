# Monte Carlo Simulations!
Traditional integration techniques are very efficient in solving simple integrals, however sometimes integrals can be impoosible to evaluate analytically leading to the use of Monte Carlo simulations. This method uses repeated random sampling to **estimate** the outcomes of an event. Using this technique, impossible to analytically calculate integrals become much more mangeable. However, due to the nature of repeated random sampling a large number of observations needs to be conducted to ensure an accurate estimate. Thus, a balance between speed and accuracy needs to be met, where the simulation is fast (lower number of observations) and accurate (higher number of observations) to the true result.

# Lennard Jones Potentials!
The Lennard Jones Potential is an approximation of the energy of nonbonded interations (Equation 1). It is a pairwise potential and can be visualized as a graph with two main sections, a repulsive part and an attractive part. Starting far apart, the pair of atoms have negligible interactions and their potenial is ~0, however as you bring them closer together the interaction becomes attactive until a global minimum value of -1 is reached. After this point bringing them any further, causes the interaction to become repulsive with energy potentials reaching infinity as the distance between them approaches 0. Conducting the approximation in reduced units is ideal because using SI units makes the values incredibility inconvinient to work with due to their very large or very small values and the inherent floating point error. The total pair potential energy of a system of particles can also be calculated, by calculating the sum of the Lennard Jones energy over all pairwise interations.

# Python!
Writing code is a useful skill but documenting your code is an essential good coding practice. Writing docstrings within functions gives other programmers a rough idea of what your function does and what its parameters are. To write a docstring, start by writing three quotes and seperating them with a line. Begin your docstring with a title of the function followed up with a short description (sometimes a title is descriptive enough). After the introduction you should write out the parameters used by the function as well as their data type and a short description. Then you should write what the function returns as well as its data type and a short description. Finally, you can conclude your docstring with some examples and the expected output.

Testing and debugging code is another useful skill and can be done painlessly using the **assert** function in python. To use it, write assert followed by an argument that you believe is true. If it is indeed true, when you run the command nothing will happen. However if it is false, then you will get an assertion error which you will need to troubleshoot.

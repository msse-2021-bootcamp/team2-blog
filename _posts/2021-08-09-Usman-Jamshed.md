# Usman Jamshed
Usman was born in Brooklyn, NY.
He's been living in Toronto since he was 8 years old

## Pets
He has a cat pet called sage like the color :)
When he was growing up his family wanted low commitment animals, so when he had about 10 boggies. 
Some flew away and some died :(. 
Then they got a cat. 

## Food
His fav: Slice of pizza, a plain thin cheese pizza. He really prefers pizza cooked in top stone oven. High fat low mouiture, it does not split as easily, it is very watery. No garnish just plain cheese. 
Pizza Nova is his favorite place. 
Least fav: Quinoa, he had a bad experience when he ordered a quinoa dish and has hated it ever since. No quinoa for Usman. 

## What we have in common
I found three things we have in common:
* We both love wood oven or stone top oven thin cheese pizzas.
* We both love animals.
* We both really like hiking and go on hiking trips. 

## Interests
Learning new things is one of his main iterests. 

He likes soccer, tennis, and swimming. He competed at high-school level. 
His main stroke is free-style and you will hardly even see him backsrtoking.

Also, He likes eating the fresh tomatoes his father grows. His father grows heirloom tomatoes, zuchinis, and eggplants on their back garden. He mentioned the tomatoes.

He considers himself as outdoorsy. He has never gone camping or fishing, but would like to go in that type of adventure someday. He likes going hiking around the area or even during travels to different type rated trails. He remembers the Vancouver Jokffre Lake trail as one of the most challenging ones his done. Mainly because he was fasting for Ramadan and it was tough to make to the end of the 6 hour hike.

# About!
Kevin is from LA and lived there for 18 years, but is currently living in San Francisco. His favourite food is seared scallops from Octavia, which was so good that he had to take a moment in the resturant to collect himself. His least favourite food is cucumbers which he detests and will not eat food which has been "contaminated" with them. He is very much an indoor person and enjoys overcast days right before its going to rain. He enjoys socializing through video games board games and loves hosting dinner parties and cooking for his friends. 

# Pets!
No pets ðŸ˜ž.

# Hobbies!
Enjoys Pokemon and has bought all releases religiously up till Pokemon Sword and Shield, but isn't really excited for the upcoming releases due to GameFreaks past short comings. Kevin listens to alot of EDM and enjoys raves. He is a huge fan of Porter Robinson because hes able to express a strong sense of escapism through his music. Proter Robinson's new album Nurture, is centered around his mental health which Kevin really resonated with and is hands down his favourite album of 2021. He also loves being part of the community and enjoys building a craft for others to enjoy.
